# Goods_manager

## Prerequisites
-------------
        macOS Sierra 10.12.6
        Qt 5.10.1 clang 64bit

## Compiling
-------------
        Open "manager.pro" used "Qt Creator".

## Hint
-------------
        You can operate multiple goods at the same time, separating each one with a line feed.
        You are supposed to separate the name and quantity of the goods by space when you pull or push.
        You can use any language you like (I guess).
